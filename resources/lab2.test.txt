      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on

      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and

        PCT Result          Interpretation.
        ___________________________________________________________________
        <0.50 ng/mL         Low risk for sepsis; Avoid antibiotics
                            unless there are local signs/symptoms
                            of infection
        >=0.5 - <2.00 ng/mL Sepsis possible, but consider other
                            conditions as well; Avoid antibiotics unless
                            there are local signs/symptoms of infection
        >2.0 - <10.00 ng/mL Sepsis likely; Recommend empiric
                            antibiotics tailored to likely infection site
        >10.00 ng/mL        Severe bacterial sepsis or septic shock
                            probable; Recommend empiric antibiotics
                            tailored to likely infection site
        __________________________________________________________________
        **Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely
        on PCT concentrations.**
        PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the
        clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes
        in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality and overall mortality
        are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing
        patient risk factors and clinical course.

      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.

      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and

Comment: MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIAE ANTIBODY (IGG)
        REFERENCE RANGE: <=0.90

        Interpretive criteria:
           <=0.90 Negative
           0.91-1.09 Equivocal
           >=1.10 Positive

        A positive IgG antibody result indicates
        that the patient has antibody to Mycoplasma.
        It does not differentiate between an active
        or past infection. The clinical diagnosis
        must be interpreted in conjunction with the
        clinical signs and symptoms of the patient.
        MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIAE ANTIBODY (IGM)
        REFERENCE RANGE: <770 U/mL

        Interpretive criteria:
                <770 U/mL Negative
                770-950 U/mL Low positive
                >950 U/mL Positive

        A positive IgM antibody result is consistent
        with recent infection. However, a negative
        result does not necessarily rule out recent
        infection as some individuals may not mount
        another IgM response, if previously infected.

Comment: Positive results have not been confirmed and should not be used for
        non-medical purposes. Contact the laboratory at ext. 5709 for
        further testing if the results conflict with the clinical picture.
        Urine Specimens that contain less than 20 mg/dL of creatinine are
        highly likely to be artificially diluted.
        ETHANOL is below the analytical measurable range.

      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

Comment: Values obtained from A1C measurements can vary.For typical A1C
        assays, a reported value of 7.0 could actually be between 6.72 and
        7.28 if measured by a reference method.A reported value of 9.0
        could actually be between 8.73 and 9.27. Ref:
        http://www.ngsp.org/CAPdata.asp

        Below is the current recommendation:
        Less than 5.7=Normal glucose metabolism
        5.7-6.5=Impaired glucose metabolism
        Greater than 6.5=Diabetes - target HBA1c dependent on individual
        patient goals and other health issues

      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

        PCT Result          Interpretation.
        ___________________________________________________________________
        <0.50 ng/mL         Low risk for sepsis; Avoid antibiotics
                            unless there are local signs/symptoms
                            of infection
        >=0.5 - <2.00 ng/mL Sepsis possible, but consider other
                            conditions as well; Avoid antibiotics unless
                            there are local signs/symptoms of infection
        >2.0 - <10.00 ng/mL Sepsis likely; Recommend empiric
                            antibiotics tailored to likely infection site
        >10.00 ng/mL        Severe bacterial sepsis or septic shock
                            probable; Recommend empiric antibiotics
                            tailored to likely infection site
        __________________________________________________________________
        **Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely
        on PCT concentrations.**
        PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the
        clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes
        in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality and overall mortality
        are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing
        patient risk factors and clinical course.

      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.

      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An

Comment: Positive results have not been confirmed and should not be used for
        non-medical purposes. Contact the laboratory at ext. 5709 for
        further testing if the results conflict with the clinical picture.
        Urine Specimens that contain less than 20 mg/dL of creatinine are
        highly likely to be artificially diluted.
        Positive Cutoff Value for OPIATES = 265 mA/min
        Positive Cutoff Value for CANNABINOIDS = 355 mA/min
        ETHANOL is below the analytical measurable range.

      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on

      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.

      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and

Comment: Target A1C values should be individualized. Better understanding of
        A1C test result accuracy is essential if clinicians are to
        interpret results for Veterans, and discuss treatment options
        through the process of Shared Decision Making.
        Contact your laboratory at 559-225-6100 ext. 5709 for performance
        characteristics of this assay.

        Below is the current recommendation:
        Less than 5.7  =  Normal glucose metabolism
        5.7-6.5  =  Impaired glucose metabolism
        Greater than 6.5  =  Diabetes - target HBA1c dependent on
        individual patient goals and other health issues
