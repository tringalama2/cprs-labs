      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

      Eval: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

      Eval: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on

      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's

      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or

      Eval: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

        >2.0 - <10.00 ng/mL Sepsis likely; Recommend empiric
                            antibiotics tailored to likely infection site
        >10.00 ng/mL        Severe bacterial sepsis or septic shock
                            probable; Recommend empiric antibiotics
                            tailored to likely infection site
        __________________________________________________________________
        **Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely
        on PCT concentrations.**
        PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the
        clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes
        in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality and overall mortality
        are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing
        patient risk factors and clinical course.

      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

                            unless there are local signs/symptoms
                            of infection
        >=0.5 - <2.00 ng/mL Sepsis possible, but consider other
                            conditions as well; Avoid antibiotics unless
                            there are local signs/symptoms of infection
        >2.0 - <10.00 ng/mL Sepsis likely; Recommend empiric
                            antibiotics tailored to likely infection site
        >10.00 ng/mL        Severe bacterial sepsis or septic shock
                            probable; Recommend empiric antibiotics

        __________________________________________________________________
        **Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely
        on PCT concentrations.**
        PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the
        clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes
        in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality and overall mortality
        are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing
        patient risk factors and clinical course.

        West Nile virus (WNV) IgM is usually detectable in
        CSF from WNV-infected patients with encephalitis or
        meningitis at the time of clinical presentation.
        Because IgM antibody does not readily cross the
        blood-brain barrier, IgM antibody in CSF strongly
        suggests acute central nervous system infection.

        WNV antibody results from CSF should be interpreted
        with caution. Possible complicating factors include
        low levels of antibody found in CSF, passive transfer
        of antibodies from blood, and contamination via
        bloody spinal taps.

        Antibodies induced by other flavivirus infections
        (e.g. Dengue virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus)
        may show cross-reactivity with WNV.

      Eval: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

                            of infection
        >=0.5 - <2.00 ng/mL Sepsis possible, but consider other
                            conditions as well; Avoid antibiotics unless
                            there are local signs/symptoms of infection
        >2.0 - <10.00 ng/mL Sepsis likely; Recommend empiric
                            antibiotics tailored to likely infection site
        >10.00 ng/mL        Severe bacterial sepsis or septic shock
                            probable; Recommend empiric antibiotics

        __________________________________________________________________
        **Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely
        on PCT concentrations.**
        PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the
        clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes
        in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality and overall mortality
        are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing
        patient risk factors and clinical course.

      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on

      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe

      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported

      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and

        further testing if the results conflict with the clinical picture.
        Urine Specimens that contain less than 20 mg/dL of creatinine are
        highly likely to be artificially diluted.
        ETHANOL is below the analytical measurable range.

        <0.50 ng/mL         Low risk for sepsis; Avoid antibiotics
                            unless there are local signs/symptoms
                            of infection
        >=0.5 - <2.00 ng/mL Sepsis possible, but consider other
                            conditions as well; Avoid antibiotics unless
                            there are local signs/symptoms of infection
        >2.0 - <10.00 ng/mL Sepsis likely; Recommend empiric
                            antibiotics tailored to likely infection site
        >10.00 ng/mL        Severe bacterial sepsis or septic shock
                            probable; Recommend empiric antibiotics

        **Decisions regarding antibiotic therapy should NOT be based solely
        on PCT concentrations.**
        PCT results should always be interpreted in the context of the
        clinical status of the patient and other laboratory results. Changes
        in PCT levels for the prediction of mortality and overall mortality
        are strongly dependent on many factors, including pre-existing
        patient risk factors and clinical course.

      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.
