      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An

      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.

        Vitamin D3, 1,25(OH)2 indicates both endogenous
        production and supplementation. Vitamin D2, 1,25(OH)2
        is an indicator of exogenous sources, such as diet or
        supplementation. Interpretation and therapy are based
        on measurement of Vitamin D, 1,25 (OH)2, Total.

Comment: Values obtained from A1C measurements can vary.For typical A1C
        assays, a reported value of 7.0 could actually be between 6.72 and
        7.28 if measured by a reference method.A reported value of 9.0
        could actually be between 8.73 and 9.27. Ref:
        http://www.ngsp.org/CAPdata.asp

        Below is the current recommendation:
        Less than 5.7=Normal glucose metabolism
        5.7-6.5=Impaired glucose metabolism
        Greater than 6.5=Diabetes - target HBA1c dependent on individual
        patient goals and other health issues

        This is a C-terminal PTH-RP assay. PTH-RP is useful in the
        differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and levels may be
        elevated in patients with tumor-associated hypercalcemia.
        Elevated results may also be observed in patients with renal
        disease.

        This test was developed and its analytical performance
        characteristics have been determined by Quest Diagnostics
        Nichols Institute San Juan Capistrano. It has not been
        cleared or approved by FDA. This assay has been validated
        pursuant to the CLIA regulations and is used for clinical
        purposes.

      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on

      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in

      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or

      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially

      Eval: Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) calculated using the
      Eval: 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) Collaboration
      Eval: creatinine equation; units of measure are mL/min/1.73 m2.
      Eval:
      Eval: Results are only valid for adults (=18 years) whose serum
      Eval: creatinine is in a steady state.  eGFR calculations are not valid
      Eval: for patients with acute kidney injury and for patients on
      Eval: dialysis.  Creatinine-based estimates of kidney function may also
      Eval: be inaccurate in patients with reduced creatinine generation
      Eval: due to decreased muscle mass (e.g., malnutrition, severe
      Eval: hypoalbuminemia, sarcopenia, chronic neuromuscular disease,
      Eval: amputations, severe heart failure or liver disease) and in
      Eval: patients with increased creatinine generation due to increased
      Eval: muscle mass (e.g., muscle builders, anabolic steroids) or
      Eval: increased dietary intake.
      Eval:
      Eval: As drug clearance is proportional to total GFR and not GFR indexed
      Eval: to body surface area (BSA), in individuals with a BSA substantially
      Eval: different than 1.73 m2, drug dosing should be based the reported
      Eval: eGFR value de-indexed from BSA by multiplying by the individual's
      Eval: BSA and dividing by 1.73.
      Eval:
      Eval: CKD is diagnosed based on abnormalities of kidney structure or
      Eval: function, present for >3 months, with implications for health and
      Eval: disease. CKD is classified and staged based on cause, eGFR and
      Eval: albuminuria (quantified as urine albumin to creatinine ratio). An
      Eval: eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the absence of increased urine albumin
      Eval: excretion or structural abnormalities does not represent CKD.
